<h1>PANIK</h1>
<hr>
<h4>You paniced sold, at least you didnt lose all!</h4>
<div> Part of being a good trader is respecting the 20% Stop loss and you did just that. Maybe you missed out on enourmous gains, but it's better then losing all... As long as you don't mind everyone calling you paper hands for now on.</div>
